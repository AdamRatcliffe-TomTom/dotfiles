# Dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles used to setup a new Mac, configuring system defaults and the shell, and installing apps from brew and the Mac App Store. Inspired by [Getting started with dotfiles](https://driesvints.com/blog/getting-started-with-dotfiles/).

## Usage

1. Generate new SSH keys and add them to your GitHub account.
    * Alternatively, restore your safely backed up SSH keys to `~/.ssh/`
2. Sign in to your account in the Mac App Store.
3. Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone github.com/AdamRatcliffe-TomTom/dotfiles.git
  ```
4. Run the `setup.sh` script. You'll be prompted for the adminstrator password if not already signed in as administrator.
5. Restart your computer.
